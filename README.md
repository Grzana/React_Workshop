# WRO_FER_S_13_REACT_React_Workshop

The workshop goal is to learn how to:
- divide the project to smaller React Components
- decide which Components should have constructor and which should not
- pass information from child Components to the parent Component 
- handle events correctly

The workshop is based on very simple table. There is no style inserted as the workshop purpose is improving the logic. 
The picture shows how it works.
